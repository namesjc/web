    <p class="paragraph"> The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is a road link between the Chinese cities of Hong Kong, Zhuhai, and Macau. At over 55 kilometers, it is also the world’s longest sea bridge. The extensive bridge-tunnel system consists of cable-stayed bridges, an underwater tunnel, and artificial islands. In some cases, the bridge shortens the drive from one city to the next by several hours. The new traffic link is also designed to simplify trade and exchange for the people from the three cities.Bosch Building Technologies is helping ensure greater safety and security on the bridge. The Bosch Praesideo solution has been installed to provide a high-performance public address and evacuation system that includes around 8,000 loudspeakers and over 260 amplifiers. In the event of an emergency, the system can be used to quickly and safely issue instructions for evacuation. The bridge is also equipped with a Bosch intrusion alarm system and a video surveillance system featuring Bosch Flexidome, Dinion, and Autodome cameras. Day and night, in changing or challenging light conditions, the HD cameras ensure sharp, in-focus images and greater safety for the gigantic structure. </p>
